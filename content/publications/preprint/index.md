abstract: |-
  Odor source localization is a fundamental challenge in molecular communication, environmental monitoring, disaster response, industrial safety, and robotics. In this study, we investigate three major approaches: Bayesian filtering, machine learning (ML) models, and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with the aim of odor source localization in a single-source, singlemolecule case. By considering the source-sensor architecture as a transmitter-receiver model we explore source localization under the scope of molecular communication. Synthetic datasets are generated using a 2D advection-diffusion PDE solver to evaluate each method under varying conditions, including sensor noise and sparse measurements.
