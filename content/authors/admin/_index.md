I'm a PhD student at the University of Cambridge, working at the intersection of computational neuroscience, molecular communication, and artificial intelligence. My research explores how communication and localization processes in biological and physical systems give rise to computation, learning, and intelligence bridging information theory, dynamical systems, and machine learning. My work combines mathematical modeling, deep learning, and theory-driven simulation to uncover unifying principles that connect natural and artificial information processing.
